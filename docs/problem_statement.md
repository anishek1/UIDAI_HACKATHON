# 🎯 Problem Statement — UIDAI Hackathon 2025

> **Team ID:** UIDAI_1545  
> **Track:** Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates

## The Problem We're Solving

### ❌ What We're NOT Doing (Rejected Framings)

| Weak Problem Statement | Why We Rejected It |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| "Trend analysis of Aadhaar enrolments over time" | Generic, descriptive, zero differentiation |
| "State-wise distribution of Aadhaar services" | Obvious analysis any team can produce |
| "Regional disparities in coverage" | Valid but lacks specificity and actionability |

---

## ✅ Our Problem Statement

> **"Building India's Identity Lifecycle Health Index: Predicting Aadhaar Data Staleness to Prevent DBT Leakages and Authentication Failures"**

---

## The Core Insight

India's ₹10+ lakh crore Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) infrastructure depends on **accurate Aadhaar data**. When demographic details (address, mobile) or biometric data become outdated, authentication fails → DBT fails → citizens are excluded from critical welfare.

**We quantify where this risk is highest**, before failures occur.

---

## Why This Problem Matters

| Stakeholder | Pain Point We Address |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **UIDAI** | Proactive identification of districts needing outreach |
| **State Governments** | Prioritized resource allocation for update camps |
| **Citizens** | Reduced authentication failures in banking/DBT |
| **Policy Makers** | Evidence-based infrastructure investment |

---

## Our Approach: Identity Freshness Index (IFI)

We synthesize **all three datasets** into a single predictive metric:

```
IFI = (Demographic Updates + Biometric Updates) / Cumulative Enrolments
```

| IFI Score | Interpretation | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| < 0.20 | **Critical** — High staleness risk | Immediate intervention |
| 0.20–0.40 | **At Risk** — Below national average | Prioritized outreach |
| 0.40–0.60 | **Healthy** — Active refresh cycle | Maintain current ops |
| > 0.60 | **Optimal** — Strong identity hygiene | Benchmark for others |

---

## Why This Wins

| Competition Criterion | How We Excel |
|----------------------|--------------|
| **Depth of Analysis** | Trivariate: State × Age × Update Type × Time |
| **Insight Originality** | First to frame as "identity staleness" problem |
| **Technical Rigor** | Derived metrics with statistical validation |
| **Social Impact** | Directly predicts DBT failure hotspots |
| **Practical Feasibility** | Produces ranked district list for immediate action |

## Key Research Questions

1. **Where in India are Aadhaar records most likely to be stale?**
2. **Are children receiving mandatory 5-year biometric updates at expected rates?**
3. **Does weekend service reduction create temporal inequity for working citizens?**
4. **Which states show lifecycle mismatch between old enrolments and current updates?**

---

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Identity Freshness Index (IFI)** — State and district rankings
2. **Child Lifecycle Coverage Map** — Tracking mandatory biometric updates
3. **Temporal Access Equity Score** — Weekend vs weekday service analysis
4. **District Priority Matrix** — Specific intervention recommendations
5. **₹ Impact Quantification** — Estimated DBT at risk
